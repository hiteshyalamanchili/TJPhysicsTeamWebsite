            <p>Shankar is a former TJ Physics Team captain who has brought about tremendous changes in the organization and structure of the team during his tenure. Furthermore, he has written and presented many fascinating lectures over the years, even after graduating from TJ. In addition, Shankar was selected as a member of the 2015 U.S. Physics Team, and is now a freshman at MIT planning on majoring in Physics.</p>
            <p>Ross is the current Physics Team captain and has been contributing to the team for the last four years with his sophisticated lectures and presentations. In addition to physics, Ross also greatly enjoys math and chemistry. He is also an experienced LaTeX professional and the man behind the impressive figures in this book.</p>
            <p>Shankar and Ross were motivated to write this book in an effort to make the underlying elegance of physics apparent. It is our and their hope that this book will be helpful for the many physics students studying mechanics in TJ and across the world.</p>

        <div class="well">
            <p>This book aims to present a self-contained survey of important topics in classical mechanics. Starting from basic mathematical foundations, Newtonian mechanics is developed with an emphasis on problem solving methods and advanced topics. The later, increasingly sophisticated chapters go beyond the material usually covered in an introductory course. They delve into topics including gyroscopic motion, central forces and scattering, oscillations, wave analysis, and special relativity.</p>
            <p>A great deal of emphasis is placed on problem solving. Over 150 worked examples are distributed throughout the text and model a variety of useful techniques. Additionally, each chapter finishes with an extensive and difficult problem set. A special effort has been made to make these problem sets diverse and challenging; they should serve as rigorous tests of understanding, as well as avenues for further exploration.</p>
            <p>In addition to the main material, this book contains over 250 figures and detailed appendices on multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. </p>

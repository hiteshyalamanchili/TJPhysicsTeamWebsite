            <h1>About Physics Team</h1>
        </div>
        The mission of TJ Physics Team is simple: to foster a passion for physics. Our officers come into every meeting aiming to share their passion for physics and show the members that physics is beautiful. We aim to spark interest in those who are beginning to learn physics, while providing a training ground for more experienced members. We aspire for every member to take away new insights and improve their problem solving skills at our meetings. We believe that every member, no matter what their physics background is, can work in a collaborative environment where they can learn from each other and help to improve each other's understanding. In fulfillment of this mission, we have three different teams (A, B, and C) to cater studentsâ€™ varying abilities, ranging from no experience to a post-AP Physics level.

                <h2>A Team</h2>
                <p>This team is designed for people who have already learned or know the traditional classical mechanics that is taught here at TJ. This team will cover other branches of physics such as thermodynamics, special relativity, optics, waves, and electrodynamics. In fact, most of these topics will be covered in the interest of preparing for the USAPhO semifinalist exam. This team also recommends a fairly deep understanding of multivariable calculus, but it is not required as it will be taught on the go.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h2>B Team</h2>
                <p>This team is designed for people who are currently enrolled in AP Physics, although anyone can join. For the first half of the year, we will focus on mechanics in accordance with the AP Physics course, although we may go deeper than the AP course goes in certain areas. This team will also spend some time preparing for the F=ma exam, which is the equivalent of the AMC 12 exam for the Physics Olympiad. For the second half of the year, we will cover electricity and magnetism and review for the AP exam in May.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h2>C Team</h2>
                <p>Unlike the other two teams, this team will be based more on understanding physics from an experimentalist point of view through demonstrations. It is catered to students who have not been exposed to calculus, but are still genuinely interested in learning physics. This team will focus on topics such as an introduction to mechanics, optics, and E&amp;M and will be often be catered to whatever the team is interested in learning.</p>
